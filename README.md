# Object-Detection-YOLOv5

This repository contains code and resources for object detection using YOLOv5. The project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for detecting objects in images and videos using the state-of-the-art YOLOv5 architecture.

## Introduction
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and localizing objects of interest in images or videos. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm known for its real-time performance. YOLOv5 is the latest iteration of the YOLO series, and it builds upon its predecessors by introducing various improvements in speed and accuracy.

## Dataset
To train and evaluate the YOLOv5 model, we require a labeled dataset of images or videos with bounding box annotations for the target objects. The repository provides a sample dataset to get started, but you can replace it with your own dataset for more specific object detection tasks.

## Model Architecture
YOLOv5 utilizes a deep convolutional neural network to detect objects in images or video frames. It adopts a single-stage approach, where the object detection and classification are performed in a single pass through the network. The architecture consists of a backbone network, feature pyramid, and detection heads to generate bounding box predictions.
